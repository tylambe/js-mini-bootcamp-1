# Hack Reactor: JavaScript Mini Bootcamp I

Welcome to part one (of two) of Hack Reactor's JavaScript Mini Bootcamp. You're here to solidify your understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts. In today's session we'll be covering the following topics:

- Part I: Foundations of Programming
- Part II: Functions
- Part III: Booleans, Comparisons & Conditionals
- Part IV: Logical Operators & Advanced Conditionals
- Part V: Variables

Each section consists of a lecture followed by a set of self-guided exercises. The self-guided exercises can be found in each section's respective folder in this repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have a JavaScript console open (like <a href="http://www.repl.it/languages/javascript" target="_blank">repl.it</a>), so you can complete all of the exercises.
